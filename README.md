# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis-
Repo for analysing the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team for MechaCar

### Background
A few weeks after starting his new role, Jeremy is approached by upper management about a special project. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. AutosRUs’ upper management has called on Jeremy and the data analytics team to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG : Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes

- Q.1 Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Each Pr(>|t|) value represents the probability that each coefficient contributes a random amount of variance to the linear model.Using the MechaCar_mpg dataset,we can see that the vehicle_length and ground_clearance have a significant imapct on mpg.

- Q.2 Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Q.3 Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

### Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils : Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots

### Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils : Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

## Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition : Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
